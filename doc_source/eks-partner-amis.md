# Amazon EKS Partner AMIs<a name="eks-partner-amis"></a>

In addition to the official Amazon EKS\-optimized, Canonical has partnered with Amazon EKS to create worker node AMIs that you can use in your clusters\.

[Canonical](https://www.canonical.com/) delivers a built\-for\-purpose Kubernetes Node OS image\. This minimized Ubuntu image is optimized for Amazon EKS and includes the custom AWS kernel that is jointly developed with AWS\. For more information, see [Ubuntu and Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes \(EKS\)](https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/aws-eks/) and [Optimized Support for Amazon EKS on Ubuntu 18\.04](http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/optimized-support-amazon-eks-ubuntu-1804/)\.
